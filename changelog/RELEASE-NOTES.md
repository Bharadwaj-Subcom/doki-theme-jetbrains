# 78.0-1.0.6 [The Boys]

I'm trying to bring in a bit of inclusion.

**4 New Dark Themes!**

- I can already hear you now, "Rimiru Tempest, from 'That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime', is not a boy. They are the best genderless slime, get your facts correct." Yeah well....shut up.
- Next, is one of the S ranked heroes in the 'One Punch Man' universe, Genos.
- After that, is the smug smile of Yukihira Soma from Shokugeki no Soma.
- Lastly, I am going to be honest, I haven't seen Haikyu. I just wanted a Indigo & Orange based theme. So here is Hinata Shoyo.

- Update tree drag-and-drop colorings to be themed.
- Better GO language syntax highlighting support.
- Fixed issue with multiple background images displaying over the update notification when the Doki Theme's wallpaper is activated ([#499](https://github.com/doki-theme/doki-theme-jetbrains/issues/499))
