Other Stuff
---

- Updated the version control uncommitted line markers on the right-hand side (next the scrollbar) to be more visible. ([#446](https://github.com/doki-theme/doki-theme-jetbrains/issues/446))
- Added `Discreet Mode`, when enabled will clear and not show any anime in the IDE. Also, the theme name in the status bar will temporarily hide as well. Is integrated with the [Anime Meme Plugin](https://github.com/ani-memes/AMII#discreet-mode), for the ultimate shame hiding experience.
- Updates the colors used by the [IDE Features Trainer](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8554-ide-features-trainer) plugin, for a more consistent learning experience.
- Made it easier to differentiate the search & selection background colors for all **61** themes. <sup><sup>Some days I question my current life choices....</sup></sup>
- Added localization for all people hanging out in the Russian Federation. Thank you @Dragon-0609 for the translations!
