#### Motivation

I am in a position where I will now regularly be using my light themes more often. I am also planning on adding more.
Most of my light themes were created a long time ago and my tastes have evolved over time.
I have taken the time to revisit a fair number of my legacy themes, light and dark.
If you want the old syntax highlighting back, then feel free to reach
out [in this discussion thread](https://github.com/doki-theme/doki-theme-jetbrains/discussions/509).
I will provide you assets and instructions on how to revert the color scheme back.

Thank you for your understanding!
