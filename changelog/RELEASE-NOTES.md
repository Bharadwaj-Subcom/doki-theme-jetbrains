_Zero Two's Not Just A Cutie. ;)_

**4 New Themes!**

- I decided that I didn't have enough Zero Two themes, so I fixed that. She now has a new top-tier dark hacker theme: `Obsidian`. I also felt like Red Zero Two doesn't get enough attention, so I added a light `Sakura` theme which features her as she was as a child. With all these new Zero Two themes, I thought it would be best to rename the existing dark & light themes to \`Rose\` & \`Lily\` respectively.
- It wouldn't be the _Darling_ release if I didn't include Hiro as well. (Dark Theme)
- Lastly, this is the first release with a duo theme! (Nao's doesn't count, I just wanted the melon meme.) Just to pad my Zero Two theme stats, I've now got a Hiro & Zero Two couples' dark theme.

### Other Stuff

- Desaturated Itsuki's theme a bit.
- Adjusted CC's inlay color.
- Fixed differentiation fo un-versioned files in VCS.
- Allowed you to opt-out of promotional content.
- Changed [Anime Meme Plugin](https://github.com/ani-memes/AMII) promotion to a notification.
