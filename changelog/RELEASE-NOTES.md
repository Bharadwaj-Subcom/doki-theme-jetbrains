![v84 Girls](https://doki.assets.unthrottled.io/misc/v84_girls_small.png)

This release is not for my Dark Theme Normies. Dark themes are nice, but I like Light Themes too (and my Dark Theme Normies). I'm currently trying new things out. Sorry in advance if I made your eyes bleed. I might tweak some of them as time goes on, still not 100% on what looks good & also is a fun color.

**6 New Light Themes!**

- Tired & broken down programmers rejoice! Even though you will never be pampered by a real Fox-demigod, you can now at least code with one. Let "The Helpful Fox Senko-san" watch over you as complete your tickets. You can almost feel the "„Åä„Åã„Åà„Çä„Å™„ÅÆ„Åò„ÇÉ" you will never get üò≠
- I decided to complete my Quintessential Quintuplets collection by adding the oldest and youngest quint: Nakano Ichika & Nakano Itsuki.
- Tomori Nao, from Charlotte, has an interesting dichotomy when it comes to her personality. She is super cute tho.
- Have I ever seen Code Geass? No. Can I appreciate C.C. without having seen the anime? Yeah buddy.
- Guess while I'm talking about "anime I haven't seen but, chose to make a theme because the girl is pretty." We now have Yuzuriha Inori from Guilty Crown.

### Other Stuff

- Adjusted Sayori's dark diff deleted color & updated Satsuki's light autocomplete letter match color.
- Updated `Weak Warning` underline color for light & dark themes.
- Changed added & modified VCS file colors to be more usable for light & dark themes.
- Migrating MacOS users on 2022.2 builds to not use the provided themed title bar, as it has native support now.
- Fixed issue when opening the update notification for some users.
- Fixed issue with stickers keeping the previously sized sticker when adjusting the size of the sticker.
- Added more consistent support for Java module material file icons.
